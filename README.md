# avalanche
 **This is a simple prototype of how our project will work.**

In this simple prototype, our graphical user interface (GUI) application demonstrates a fundamental capability: the conversion of a base64 encoded image into a visual format. However, it's important to note that the full scope of our project extends beyond this preliminary version. Future implementations will encompass a sophisticated analysis of incline and a range of diverse climatic factors, enabling the system to make predictions regarding potential avalanche occurrences. It's worth mentioning that, due to the early stage of development, the complete code is not provided here to safeguard against potential copyright concerns. 

**This basic prototype lays the foundation for a more comprehensive and powerful tool aimed at enhancing avalanche prediction and safety measures.**
